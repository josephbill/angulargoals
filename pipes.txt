Pipes in angular take in an input and generate a desired output. Angular has several inbuilt pipes that we can use but
 we can also make our own custom pipes : We can also chain pipes to extend the transformation of the input that we give to a pipe.

 examples of inbuilt pipes include : date,uppercase ... look for more


Creating Pipes
$ ng generate pipe nameofPipe;

A pipe file consists of the following

imports
@pipe annotation : has a property name : use this name to refer to pipe in HTML content.

finally class defination : export etc. with a transform function which can take in any value.
