1. Handle them by creating form components : ng generate components componentName
2. To make forms work in angular , import the forms module to app.modules.ts
3. Form Validation is handled using :
    a. a reference variable in the template for each input , attribute [hidden] to hide errors before displaying them.
    b. a property called pristine which allows us to hide the alert when we load a blank page.
    check this example in the goal form html file

4. to submit a form we use the directive called ngSubmit
